## Welcome to THE MARBLE GAME

The Marble Game was created for RE:SLO Hacks in Fall 2021. It is played on Arduino. This balancing game involves "rolling" a marble on a platform without dropping it!

### Gameplay
Player controls "tilt" of the platform and the speed and direction of the ball. Turning the knob further in either direction will increase the velocity in that direction. The player should try to remain balanced at all times!

### Levels
- Practice Level: Player must keep the ball on the platform. Player cannot win.
- Level 1: Player must hit a target with the ball. Player wins by pressing a button once the ball has hit the target.
- Level 2: Player must hit a target with the ball while the computer changes the platform tilt. Player wins by pressing a button once the ball has hit the target.

### Messages
Player can receive a number of messages while playing the game! Here's what they mean:
1. "You Suck" - your ball has rolled off the platform
2. "Nope" - you pressed the button, but the ball wasn't on the target
3. "You Win!!!" - congrats!
